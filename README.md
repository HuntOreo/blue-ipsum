# Webpack Template

This is a template repo to be used when creating simple webpack projects. 

The idea of the project was to build a multi-page website using 'components' via javascript. Everything is rendered using pure javascript. Each section of the page is treated as its own component, stuffed inside its own javascript file and imported when used. 

I also am using helper functions i created to build and append the elements, along with generic elements like 'Button' which has their own api's tied to them to allow customization within javascript.
